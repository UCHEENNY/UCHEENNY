### ✨ Fun Fact – My Cyber Side

I’m on a mission to turn business instincts into cybersecurity superpowers.  
With curiosity as my compass and the terminal as my toolkit, I explore the digital world—from ethical hacking to GRC, and everything in between.

You'll often find me:
- Juggling open-source tools  
- Running penetration tests  
- Analyzing logs like a SOC analyst on caffeine ☕  
- Mapping out GRC strategies that actually make sense ✅

Whether it’s scanning with `theHarvester`, digging into WHOIS records, or writing up findings in a clean report, I love breaking things *just* enough to understand how to secure them better.

**Always learning. Always collaborating. Always defending.**  
Let’s build safer systems—one script, one policy, and one alert at a time. 🛡️💻🔍
